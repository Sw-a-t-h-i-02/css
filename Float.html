            Pusarla Venkata Sindhu is a sporting icon of the 21st century and a shining beacon for sportswomen in India. The shuttler has risen to the top of the world in the last decade, winning dozens of titles across the globe.
            After becoming the first Indian woman to win a silver medal at the Olympics and gold at the BWF World Championships, PV Sindhu added another piece of metal to her glittering cabinet by winning her second straight Olympic medal - a bronze at Tokyo 2020, thus becoming the first Indian woman to win two Olympic medals.
            PV Sindhu’s consistency at the highest level can somewhat be attributed to the sporting genes she inherited from her parents. Born July 5, 1995, in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh to parents who were both volleyball players at the national level, sport already coursed through PV Sindhu’s veins since she was born.
            While her parents may have been volleyball players, badminton caught PV Sindhu’s fancy after watching Pullela Gopichand in action, and by the age of eight, she was a regular at the sport.
            PV Sindhu’s tournament, bar her stutter in the semi-final, was nothing short of dominant.
            The shuttler cruised through the competition’s early group play stage, dispensing quickly with Ksenia Polikarpova of Israel 2-0 (21-7, 21-10) and then Cheung Ngan Yi in similar fashion, 2-0 (21-9, 21-16).
            41 minutes was all time it took for Sindhu to fly through to the quarterfinals. Denmark’s Mia Blichfeldt fell at the Indian’s hands 2-0 (21-15, 21-13). Akane Yamaguchi**,** the number four seed, suffered a similar fate thereafter. Sindhu powered through 2-0, once again without dropping a set.
            For so long, the big titles eluded the Hyderabad shuttler with Sindhu having a string of runner-up finishes - including being a beaten finalist at the 2017 and 2018 World Championships - which led her to be dubbed “Silver Sindhu”.
            Between those two Worlds, the top-ranked Indian shuttler only won the 2017 Korea Open from five finals and three semi-final appearances.
            Sindhu said, "People started asking me, 'What's happening? You come to the finals - It's finals phobia."
            But it was a case of third time lucky for Sindhu who became the first Indian player in history to win a world badminton title in 2019.
