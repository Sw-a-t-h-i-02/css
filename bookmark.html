            Holden’s career at Pencey Prep has been marred by his refusal to apply himself, and after failing four of his five subjects—he passed only English—he has been forbidden to return to the school after the fall term. The Saturday before Christmas vacation begins, Holden stands on Thomsen Hill overlooking the football field, where Pencey plays its annual grudge match against Saxon Hall. Holden has no interest in the game and hadn’t planned to watch it at all. He is the manager of the school’s fencing team and is supposed to be in New York for a meet, but he lost the team’s equipment on the subway, forcing everyone to return early.
            Holden is full of contempt for the prep school, but he looks for a way to “say goodbye” to it. He fondly remembers throwing a football with friends even after it grew dark outside. Holden walks away from the game to go say goodbye to Mr. Spencer, a former history teacher who is very old and ill with the flu. He sprints to Spencer’s house, but since he is a heavy smoker, he has to stop to catch his breath at the main gate. At the door, Spencer’s wife greets Holden warmly, and he goes in to see his teacher.

                Spencer's farewell turns into a lecture on discipline, and Holden's mind drifts. He wonders about the ducks down at the lagoon near Central Park South in New York City. Where do they go when the lagoon freezes in the winter? Does someone take them to a zoo? Do they fly away? He reflects on Mr. Haas, the phony headmaster at Elkton Hills, one of Holden's previous schools. Haas was very charming to successful-looking parents, but if a boy's mother were fat or his father poorly dressed, the headmaster snubbed them cruelly.
                Holden finally manages to escape from Mr. Spencer's lecture, claiming he needs to get to the gym to retrieve his equipment. He has second thoughts about leaving "old Spencer" but mainly wants out. Politely turning down a cup of Mrs. Spencer's renowned hot chocolate and promising to write, he gladly leaves.
                Kindly Mrs. Spencer is the one who invites Holden into the couple's modest home and directs him toward the ailing instructor's bedroom. Holden's background is sufficiently privileged that he mentions the absence of servants to open the doors to visitors. The Spencers are an elderly couple, although we need to be cautious about specifics because Holden tends to exaggerate. He mentions several "old guy" habits that Mr. Spencer indulges in and a few other human failings that annoy him. Worst is the reading aloud of Holden's final exam from Spencer's history class.

            Holden lives in Ossenburger Hall, which is named after a wealthy Pencey graduate who made a fortune in the discount funeral home business. In his room, Holden sits and reads Isak Dinesen’s Out of Africa while wearing his new hunting hat, a flamboyant red cap with a long peaked brim and earflaps. He is interrupted by Ackley, a pimply student who lives next door. According to Holden, Ackley is a supremely irritating classmate who constantly barges into the room, exhibits disgusting personal habits and poor hygiene, and always acts as if he’s doing others a favor by spending time with them. Ackley does not seem to have many friends. He prevents Holden from reading by puttering around the room and pestering him with annoying questions. Ackley further aggravates Holden by cutting his fingernails on the floor, despite Holden’s repeated requests that he stop. He refuses to take Holden’s hints that he ought to leave. When Holden’s handsome and popular roommate, Stradlater, enters, Ackley, who hates Stradlater, quickly returns to his own room. Stradlater mentions that he has a date waiting for him but wants to shave.

            Having nothing better to do, Holden keeps Stradlater company as he shaves. Holden notes that Stradlater is a “secret” slob, who is handsome but has personal habits that are nearly as dirty as Ackley’s, though nobody would ever know this unless they roomed with him. As he shaves, he asks Holden to do him a favor by completing his English homework for him. Because he thinks it’s good for people like Stradlater to experience a bit of suspense in their lives, though, Holden doesn’t answer right away, instead asking whom Stradlater is dating. When Stradlater doesn’t immediately tell him, Holden jumps up and puts him in a half-nelson, taking him by surprise and momentarily infuriating him. With ease, Stradlater escapes Holden’s grip and tells him to “cut out the crap.
            Although Holden likes Stradlater, he still recognizes the many ways in which his roommate is a “phony.” For instance, he notices that Stradlater presents himself as clean and handsome even though he’s actually quite messy. That Holden even takes note of this is worth considering, since it’s such a trivial thing to seize upon. After all, the discrepancy between Stradlater’s public image and his personal hygiene is rather unremarkable, since most people have aspects of their personality that they choose not to show the world. To Holden, though, this is a sign of inauthenticity.
